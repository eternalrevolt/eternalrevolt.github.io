Although legendary and oft repeated quotes on the internet are sometimes inaccurate, and I have not been able to verify this one, the statement itself is very true:

## **God has not called me to be successful; He has called me to be faithful.**

 ***-Mother Teresa of Calcutta*** As you carry Christ's message to the world, do not despair if no one hears you in the present. If you never seem to get ahead, if you barely keep your head above water - it doesn't matter in the end. We are called to be faithful to a divine will, something not of this world. Material success is measured in worldly terms, and is worth nothing in the end. So remember what it is you are called to be working towards. Let all that does not matter truly slide.
