I have been silent, in terms of writing, for some time. The last 6 years I have had regular employment, and that coupled with my primary responsibilities as husband and father has left little time, energy, or inclination to reach out to a broader audience.

However, I write now in a time of crisis and unrest, with a heart weighed heavy with the events of this past week, and even the past many years. This has been even more difficult with the things I am seeing from old contacts and organizations with whom I had dealings many years ago.

**For that reason, whether or not anyone reads this, I feel it necessary to add my voice to those condemning the riot and insurrection in Washington D.C. this past week on the feast of the Epiphany.**

**The "Eternal Revolution" is not violent.** It is a personal turning of the self to be better, always, and through that movement of virtue to a way of setting the world aflame in the fire of charity. This ideal is expressed by G.K. Chesterton in *Orthodoxy* (From which comes the title "Eternal Revolution." Likewise the idea of "Pray for Revolution" (from GKC's *Wind in the Trees*) is not meant to be the a request from God for violence, any more than the rest of the *Our Father* would be. Jesus denied violent revolution as a solution to a people far more oppressed and far more justified in a physical uprising than we in our own privileged time and place.

> Since it is lawful to pray for the coming of the kingdom, it is lawful also to pray for the coming of the revolution that shall restore the kingdom.

During my freelance career, my writing has appeared in many publications. I worked with them and lent my services for the accomplishment of certain mutual social action goals - most notably an opposition to abortion - but it does not mean I condone their platform or methods as a whole.

Back in my day, "pro-life" organizations would unequivocally condemn violence, and those who called for violence, even with the goal of ending the practice of abortion. Not only to I not see that sentiment expressed now, but even justifications or sympathy expressed for those who participated, instigated, encouraged, these terrible events. The consequences of such action must be faced with dignity, and not whining or excuses.

The established "Pro-Life" movement and the modern American cult of Christianity have put their faith in princes, and so have sown the salt of hypocrisy underfoot in the soil in the proclamation of hatred towards enemies instead of love for all mankind, and charitable correction of wrongs. Thus we reap a futile harvest.

This does not mean I have "joined the other side" - as if two sides of human organizations could represent right and wrong. Our two-party tyranny is in need of much reform, much correction, and much improvement. But in this case, in this post, I must strongly rebuke my former allies and condemn their actions, as it is they I have associated with in the past. The authority of those who called for violence, and the defense of it by those who proclaim themselves to be Christian or Pro-life, and the seditious goals express by participants are far more heinous than any other domestic violence perpetrated by other Americans this year, and for that reason I am calling it out in this post.

Pray for the turning of hearts. Pray that we might see peace, knowing that as a fallen people we seldom sow its seeds. Pray for those you disagree with, and show them you care for them as human beings, even as you tell them why you think they are wrong.
