As Christians, we know what we believe. It is expressed concisely in the [Apostle's Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles'_Creed) or more completely in the Bible itself. 

We have a vision. It is that of the Kingdom of Heaven, of Eden and existence beyond the Judgement, where the ideals we desire, justice, truth, and charity are perfectly expressed. 

We have a mission. The great commission at the end of the book of Matthew still applies: "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." 

With all these things, why do we falter? Why do Christians everywhere seem lukewarm, compromising, and complacent? We are not wanting of something to believe in, a vision, or a mission. We lack the courage to do what we must. We need to be reminded of what it is we are to do today for the glory of God. We need particular tasks to do. [In his private notebook, G.K. Chesterton wrote that a soldier, a knight, a warrior does not want to be reassured that his commander has a plan](http://eternalrevolution.com/want-something-guest-post-g-k-chesterton/ "A Want of Something to Do: Guest Post by G.K. Chesterton"). After all, Our Lord has an inevitable plan laid out for us and the world, repeatedly laid out in the Scriptures. What a fighter wants, remarked Chesterton, is a sword. A weapon or tool with which to strike, to struggle with, and with which he can make a difference for his cause. We have such weapons, but too often we think they are irrelevant in our time, or too simple. They are found throughout the Scriptures too. Pray. Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless. Those are the acts of a soldier of the Kingdom of Heaven. We do not need another statement of belief. We need to do.
