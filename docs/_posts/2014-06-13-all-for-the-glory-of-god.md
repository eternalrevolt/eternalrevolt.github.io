***"Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." 1 Corinthians 10:31*** As Christians, we hear the instruction to do everything for, or to, the Glory of God. But what does it actually look like when we do things for His glory, and not our own? The story of Gideon is a great example of this. The odds were against Gideon's 32,000 Israelite soldiers from the start, facing the combined Midianites and Amelekites that were too numerous to count. However, even those odds were too humanly possible. God had Gideon challenge and test the men until just 300 remained. Unlike the famous Spartans, these 300 had no allies but God alone. When instructing Gideon to reduce his fighting force, God's reason was this: 

>The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’

 When something is to be done for God's glory, it should be done without personal pride in the accomplishment, and without taking credit for it. This doesn't just apply to sports stars and performance artists. It doesn't just apply to public victory and celebration. It is supposed to apply to everything we do. Why does it seem that the biggest miracles have all happened in the past? Perhaps we have grown too confident - not just in our own abilities, but in knowing what is possible and impossible. But God is in the impossible tasks He sets before us. If we set out to do something we know is possible, and achieve it, how have we shown the glory and power of God in that achievement? But if we set out to do what is necessary, against odds that are obviously impossible - then the success can truly be a witness to God's presence and majesty.
