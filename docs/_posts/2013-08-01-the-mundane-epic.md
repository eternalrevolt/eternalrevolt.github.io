The battle of good vs evil is always easier from someone else's perspective. Few epics of high fantasy manage to capture what it is like to slog through the challenges of life. Wouldn't it be great if our life's purpose was handed to us as a powerful ring that needed to be tossed in a volcano? Most of us are assailed throughout our lives with millions of not-quite-insignificant cares and worries, and maybe a few major conflicts. A few of us might get the epic fantasy struggle that turns heads. But almost all of life's battle is fought slowly, painfully, and is tragically mundane. That does not diminish the task before you and I. The task of living each day, trying to be better than the person you were yesterday, last week, and last year. Only in the end will we know how epic our story really is.
