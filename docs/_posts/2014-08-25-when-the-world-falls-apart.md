When your world is falling apart, what is it that is actually changing so drastically? It cannot be anything that can affect your salvation. It may be a change in your role - or what you thought your role was - in the story of salvation. When Peter was called from his boat, when Paul was thrown from his horse, their old world ended. Up to that day they thought they knew what their life would be. And the next day it changed forever in response to a call. 

A few lines in the Scriptures over simplifies the upheaval such decisions and such callings cause. On that note, there will be more changes here at Eternal Revolution. The more I pray about things the more I realize a more radical course correction is needed to bring things in line with my calling. I stated in [The Eternal Revolution](http://eternalrevolution.com/eternal-revolution-book/ "The Eternal Revolution: The Book") that we are not fighting as the army of God. An army follows orders in a clear battlefront. We are resistance fighters, and part of that is shifting and responding and changing quickly to adapt to shifting conditions or orders. This is the way we fight.
