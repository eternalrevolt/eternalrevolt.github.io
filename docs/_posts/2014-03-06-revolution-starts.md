It is all too easy to push off changing the world to things that “society,” “the future,” or even worse, “the government” ought to do. You may have noticed we don’t talk a lot here on Eternal Revolution about current politics, if at all. Most of us can’t affect the power plays of the ruling class other than with our votes and the occasional participation in notification campaigns. Leaving change to something society must do is lazy and cowardly. It reduces your requirement to change things in your life, in your world, and in your sphere of influence. The Eternal Revolution, like the Kingdom it is restoring, exists in its smallest, most nuclear form within you and your family. Jesus did not call society to change. Rather, he said specifically that men’s hearts must change first. When teaching socio-economics, his command was “Go and sell what you have and give the money to the poor.” It was a a personal call to action, not a suggestion to join a political action committee. Many of us would rather cut off a hand than quit a job, for instance. Even a morally questionable job, even though we are told to sever the ties that lead us to sin - even if it be a hand or an eye. Most of us fear criticism of our fellow man more than doing the right thing. Most of the changes we need to make are not drastic, world-changing actions in the public eye. Looking to your personal economy. Look first to care for those who you have a divine charge to take care of - your children, your family, your neighbor. The revolution starts there. Don’t skip ahead.
