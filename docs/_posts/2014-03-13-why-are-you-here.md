What makes less ‘sense’: A [Christian Samurai](http://www.amazon.com/The-Way-Christian-Samurai-Servant-Warriors/dp/0977223469/ref=ragemedall) or a Christian [Financial](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%206:25-38&version=NIV)[Planner](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:16-22&version=NIV)? 

G.K. Chesterton wrote in *Orthodoxy*: “Christianity even when watered down is hot enough to boil all modern society to rags. The mere minimum of the Church would be a deadly ultimatum to the world.” Obviously that isn’t true of Anne Rice’s ‘Christianity,’ but is it even true of Dave Ramsey’s, Rick Warren’s? What about your own ‘Christianity’? 

We are not here to earn a living. We are not here to save for a comfy retirement. We are not here to be comfortable, period. We are not here to be patriotic, to serve the state, or champion a political party or philosophy. 

Our heroes are those who smashed idols, were unpopular, were traitors, rebels and enemies of the State, were exiled, and were brutally killed. 

We are here to change the world, to set it on fire. To allow the kingdom of God to come upon the earth through us. Don’t lose sight of that.
