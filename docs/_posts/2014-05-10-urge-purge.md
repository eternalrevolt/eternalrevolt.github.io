As a Christian you profess a faith in a God who provides for you, but from whom you are distracted by things of this world... If you know you could be happy with half the things you own... If you want less stuff in your life, and feel the need to simplify... If you recognize that the things you own have begun to own you, and you want to end that relationship... What's stopping you? Act on your faith. Live your hope.
