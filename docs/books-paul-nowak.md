## The Eternal Revolution: An Exhortation to the Modern Christian

The world expects Christianity to be a tame belief system of acceptance, tolerance, and kindness. Christians who are confronted with this soft view of their faith are sorely tempted to swallow it. Some of them do, others are merely left feeling conflicted and miserable. Christianity is not a religion of kindness or a faith of conformity. It is, to quote Chesterton, "a monstrous thing for which men die." ***The Eternal Revolution*** is a call to actively engage in the Christian life as an ongoing battle for the Kingdom of Heaven in the midst of a fallen world. It provides a perspective of our faith as warfare, a perspective so old it appears repeatedly in the Scriptures themselves. This book renews the challenge found throughout the Bible to fight the good fight and live as courageous warriors of spirit. Only 40 pages long, this book is short and to the point, easy to finish once you start. It does not leave the reader with vague feelings, but with specific actions they can take to change the world and bring about the fire upon the world Jesus said He came to bring. Available as an ebook for $2.99 from Amazon.

## The Way of the Christian Samurai

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">![Cover of The Way of the Christian Samurai](http://eternalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/christiansamuraicover.jpg)As Christians, we are called to be both servants and warriors for Jesus Christ.</span>The samurai, whose very title means “one who serves,” were skillful warriors of feudal Japan who devoted themselves fully to the service of their masters, willing even to sacrifice their lives in service to their lord. Christians are also called by their Lord, Jesus, to take up their cross and follow Him, and to seek to lose their life for His sake (Matthew 16:24-25). While fantastic legends and stories of the samurai are plentiful, *The Way of the Christian Samurai* draws from primary sources – notes, essays, and books written by real samurai from Japan’s feudal era. Their advice on everything from overcoming fear, giving counsel to others, serving one’s Lord, and self-sacrifice are remarkably applicable to the life of the modern Christian.

 **“The excerpts on serving one’s lord are eye-openers for any Christian with a “soft” view of service that rarely goes beyond activities at their local church. The willingness of a warrior to give himself completely to his lord underscores what it means to make oneself part of the body of Christ.”**-ChrisitanBookReviews.net

## Microcapitalist Manifesto

![Microcapitalist Manifesto cover](http://eternalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/microcapitalist_cover.jpg)Microcapitalism is an economic theory based on productive property in as many private hands as possible. Favoring small business and small government, Microcapitalism provides a reasonable alternative to unrestricted capitalism and the injustice of socialism. The Microcapitalist Manifesto explores what went wrong with runaway capitalism and the overreaction of socialism, and identifies steps every citizen can take to encourage responsible, limited capitalism without big business and big government interference. **[Buy Now From Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GSM2V8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003GSM2V8&linkCode=as2&tag=ragemedall&linkId=QYUAWOZSL5S3Z5N6)**

> **"This is an excellent booklet of what the problems are of socialism and unrestrained capitalism. Both can quickly become the snake eating itself in causing more of the problems it is trying to solve. It adeptly covers how we got here, what went wrong, where we can go. It lays out some practical differences between capitalism and microcapitalism."**
